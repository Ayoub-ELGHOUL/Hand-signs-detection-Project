# Hand-signs-detection-Project
# This project is a demo of the hand signs detection using the mediapipe framework and openCv library, I have wrote the code for just 6 hand sings, and also I used the AES encryption algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the taken screenshot and store it in saving path of your choice.
